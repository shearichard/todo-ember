# Todo-ember
This project is my sandbox to play around with a "Ember front-end / Django back-end" environment (based on https://www.smallsurething.com/making-ember-and-django-play-nicely-together-a-todo-mvc-walkthrough/) 

This project is dependent upon my [todo_django](https://github.com/shearichard/todo_django) for a backend.

As of [b4ffe4d625c2f715013066254722e18f95d2ac28](https://github.com/shearichard/todo-ember/commit/b4ffe4d625c2f715013066254722e18f95d2ac28) this project corresponds to the end of the  [Making Ember and Django play nicely together: a to-do app walkthrough](https://www.smallsurething.com/making-ember-and-django-play-nicely-together-a-todo-mvc-walkthrough/) article which I followed to create the code in the project.
